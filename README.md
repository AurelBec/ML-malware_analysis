# Malware Analysis for Machine Learning

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Requires boost libraries, boost filesystem module and a compiler supporting c++11 standards

```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

### Installing

Create the build directory if not present at ROOT

```
cd ROOT/
mkdir build
```

then

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
```

You can also run the following commands directly into the ROOT folder, but it'll flood it with unwanted files
```
cmake ./
make
```


## Running the programs

The two following classifiers are generate in the ROOT directory
  I assume that the training set are located here too, otherwise, the default paths can be changed with options

### malware detection

To use the **malware detector** with default argument, run
```
cd ROOT/
./detector
```

For help and detailled options, run
```
./mdetector help
```

### malware classification


```

```
