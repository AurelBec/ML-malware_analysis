# Malware Analysis

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Requires boost libraries, boost filesystem module and a compiler supporting c++11 standards

```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

### Installing

create the build directory if not present at ROOT

```
cd ROOT/
mkdir build
```

then

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

You can also run this command directly into the ROOT folder, but it'll flood it with unwanted files
```
cmake ./
```

## Running the programs

cd ROOT/
./mdetector
